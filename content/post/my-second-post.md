*TIP: Create a few posts like this to get some content in place and see the formatting of multiple articles in lists.

Now that you have some content, it’s time to display it. Hugo has a repository full of themes that you can use (or you can always create a custom theme). For the purposes of this tutorial, let’s use the Strata theme.

Find the Strata theme in Hugo’s theme library (or you can click here). To avoid headaches and to make it easy to tweak the theme we are just going to download the zip instead of cloning the theme’s repo. To do so, click the Clone or download button then click the Download ZIP button on the right hand side of the page. In the hugo/site directory, create a new folder called themes, then unzip the Strata file into /PATH/TO/hugo/themes. Be sure to rename the folder from hugo-strata-theme-master to just plain hugo-strata-theme.
